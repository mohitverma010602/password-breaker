***********DESIGN**********

Server Setup:
    Choose a server environment (e.g., Node.js with Express) for hosting your backend application.
    Set up necessary dependencies and middleware for handling HTTP requests, file uploads, and other functionalities.

Database Integration:
    Determine the database technology for storing user data and metadata related to uploaded PDF files (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
    Design database schemas to store user information, uploaded files, and action logs.

Authentication and Authorization:
    Implement user authentication using techniques such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.
    Create endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
    Implement authorization to ensure that users can only access their own uploaded files and perform permitted actions.

PDF Processing Services:
    Integrate libraries or services for processing PDF files (e.g., pdf-lib, PDFtk).
    Implement functions to perform actions such as password cracking, text extraction, watermarking, or merging PDF files.
    Ensure error handling and validation for uploaded files to prevent security vulnerabilities.

File Upload Handling:
    Set up routes and middleware for handling file uploads from clients.
    Implement validation and sanitization of uploaded files to prevent security threats (e.g., file type checking, size limits).
    Store uploaded files securely on the server or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).

API Endpoints:
    Define RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the backend services.
    Create endpoints for uploading PDF files, initiating actions on files, retrieving processed files, and managing user data.

Error Handling and Logging:
    Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected errors and exceptions.
    Set up logging to record important events, errors, and user activities for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Security Measures:
    Implement security best practices such as input validation, parameterized queries, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between the client and server.
    Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse and attacks (e.g., brute force protection).

Testing and Quality Assurance:
    Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of backend functionalities.
    Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks.

Deployment and Scalability:
    Choose a suitable deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform) for deploying your backend application.
    Configure auto-scaling and load balancing to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability.
    Monitor performance metrics and user analytics to optimize resource utilization and identify areas for improvement.

********ROUTES*********

Authentication Routes:
    /api/auth/register: POST request to register a new user.
    /api/auth/login: POST request to authenticate and log in a user.
    /api/auth/logout: POST request to log out a user.

PDF Upload and Processing Routes:
    /api/pdf/upload: POST request to upload a PDF file.
    /api/pdf/:id/process: POST request to initiate processing actions on a PDF file by ID.
    /api/pdf/:id/download: GET request to download a processed PDF file by ID.
    /api/pdf/:id/delete: DELETE request to delete a PDF file by ID.

*********MODELS*********

User Model:
    Fields: username, email, password, role (optional).
    Methods: generateAuthToken(), comparePassword(password).

PDF Model:
    Fields: user (reference to the User model), filename, originalFilename, path, processed (boolean flag), actions (array of performed actions).
    Methods: processActions(), download(), delete().

*********MIDDLEWARE**********
Authentication Middleware: 
    Middleware to authenticate user requests using JWT tokens or session-based authentication.

Authorization Middleware: 
    Middleware to ensure that users are authorized to perform certain actions (e.g., only the owner of a PDF file can process or delete it).
